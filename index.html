  Locate with app

  Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously placing scooters 
  in the areas with most demand, so one should never be too far away. 

  Pick your scooter

  We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So you know how much 
  charge they have left and can see roughly how much it will cost.

  Enjoy the ride

  Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put on a helmet, 
  and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and accessibility ramps.
